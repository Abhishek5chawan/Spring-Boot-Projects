- Structuring real-world backend applications  
- Implementing authentication and validations  
- Building frontends with **React.js**, as well as plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for smaller/demo UIs  
- Integrating React/front-end apps with Spring Boot backends  
- Understanding clean code and project architecture

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects

### **Backend**
```bash
# Navigate into the project folder
cd project-folder-name

# Build (Maven) and run the Spring Boot application
./mvnw clean package
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# or run the generated jar
java -jar target/your-app-name.jar
